1	Random points with uniform distribution.
2	Hammersley points with p1 = 2.
3	Hammersley points with p1 = 3.
4	Hammersley points with p1 = 5.
5	Hammersley points with p1 = 7.
6	Hammersley points with p1 = 11.
7	Halton points with p1 = 2, p2 = 3.
8	Halton points with p1 = 2, p2 = 5.
9	Halton points with p1 = 2, p2 = 7.
A	Halton points with p1 = 3, p2 = 5.
B	Halton points with p1 = 3, p2 = 7.
