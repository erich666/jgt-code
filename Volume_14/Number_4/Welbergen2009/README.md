# jgt-mixed-dynamics
Mixed dynamics code from our paper [Real-Time Animation Using a Mix of Physical Simulation and Kinematics](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/2151237X.2009.10129288), Journal of Graphics, GPU, & Game Tools, 14(4):1-21, ISSN 1086-7651, 2009.

Contains the Featherstone recursive Newton Euler inverse dynamics solver (hmi.physics.inversedynamics.RNEASolver), 
our math library (hmi.math, includes spatial algebra classes and numerical differentiation) and our implementation of 
Winter's low pass filter (hmi.math.digitalfilter.Winters).

This code here is a snapshot of the [original repo](https://github.com/herwinvw/jgt-mixed-dynamics), which we refer the interested reader to for the latest version.
